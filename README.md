## Custom C Tools

Here is a library of random tools I have constructed and used for various things. They arent polished yet, but they get the job done and are reusable.

- **Tool List**  
  - modulecheck.c/.h: handles checking kernel modules and installed applications. has a configurable search.  
  - network.c/.h: small tool for checking if program can access LAN and WAN.
